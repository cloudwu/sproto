Introduction
======

Fork from Cloudwu's Sproto https://github.com/cloudwu/sproto

This version add hash table of type/protocol names in C level, speed up querying with string, almost as fast as quering with tag, especially with huge numbers of type/protocol definitions. 

Maybe better for server side.

No lock and carefully using in thread.
